The plug-in should be triggered via the “After Refresh” event on the Classic Report region and \"Fire on Page Load\" should also be activated.<p><b>Important clarification: My work in the development team of Oracle APEX is in no way related to my open source projects or the plug-ins here on apex.world! All plug-ins are built in my spare time and are not supported by Oracle!</b></p>",
