This dynamic action plug-in is for Classic Reports. It ensures that a configured number of columns remain pinned to the left edge when scrolling horizontally. The plug-in should be triggered via the “After Refresh” event on the Classic Report region and "Fire on Page Load" should also be activated.

This plug-in only supports UT-Theme, Redwood Light theme is not supported.
